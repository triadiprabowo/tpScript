		<p>	My name is Triadi Prabowo, the man driven by an unbridled and relentless passion for web design. I am born 
			perfectionist, striving to stay on top of the scene. Likes to playing online game and arranging music using FL Studio, most of the time spent on computing and hanging out with friends. Even though I live an
			extraordinary life as one of the passionate pc geek in my family, I have always remained a down-to-earth guy. I'm constantly improving my skills, either with the design I created in my pc or en route to my
			next high-end job around the top companies.
		</p>

		<h4>The Designer</h4>
		<p>	No matter how many times I should try to get there as soon as I entered the web design world, I feel my blood boiling in my vein and I thought at the time: "This is my world!". 
			Then, I put all focus to improve my skills in web design. I learn from various sources, tutorial, and videos. As soon as the beats of designing the web already kicked in, I feel 	
			my design is invisible but really eyed-candy. My family supported me for what I am doing and I keep practicing and improving my experience in web design world.
		</p>

		<h4>The Gamer</h4>
		<p>	I'm starting playing games since my childhood, games is really helping me improving my english even though my english still not that
			good and also gaming world inspiring me to be better person. Most of games categories I played on are RPG and MMORPG, finding the exact role for what I am doing in game. Games such as Final Fantasy and
			Legend of Dragoon helped me to improved my logic.
		</p>

		<h4>How It All Began</h4>
		<p> Born in Jakarta, Indonesia (January 04, 1994), I am indulged my passion for computing from a young age. I thought at the time “So as a little nerdy kid 
			I was having my own personal computer and trying to be professional gamer and programmer.” I am making progress from time to time, start only playing games and be basic programmer kid such as making windows simple 
			virus and learning how to create the real program in Visual Basic.<br /><br />
			"I loved gaming and programming, this really piqued my interest" learning from my brother who taught me a lot how to operated pc and tweaking its system. Then, in 2009 when I created online forum coded in phpBB3 
			and I named it 'Fixy-Fact' forum specialized for online gamer. The domain was fixy-fact.com, I was experiencing how to modifying online game by making its hack / cheat. Provided by Cheat Engine to modifying 
			its binary data of the game which at the time, those games are GunBound Online Game and Crazy Kart many people joined my forum and statistics of my forum is really increased high 
			but it got banned in 2011 by OnlineGuardian for malicious contents and such. I am not giving up but to learn Desktop Windows Application in VB.NET and Java (GUI or DOS mode) and also 
			trying to mastered HTML and CSS 2.1. I re-created Fixy-Fact in 2012 placed at 'fixy-fact.net' until now but it's not really forum to visit by people anymore. 
			I'm improving my CSS skills to the next level (CSS3) until now. <br /><br />
			My big inspirator and motivator are Enzo Ferrari (Founder of Ferrari), Niki Lauda (Driver of Formula 1) and John Nash (Genius Mathematician) which all of them can be success at their life because 
			all of sacrifices have been made and I know everything good comes at price so I am willing to do anything to achieve my goals. <br /><br />
			Now, I am good and improving my programming language skills in VB.NET, Java, PHP, HTML, CSS, MySQL and SQL Server. 
			"Technology should connect us. As long as technology keeps evolving like it is, I will continue and I don’t see any reason to slow it down.”
